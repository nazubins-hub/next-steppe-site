# Next Steppe — site

Xeriscape plant reference and practice site for the Vail Valley, built with
[Astro](https://astro.build), static output, deployed on Cloudflare Pages.

## Local dev

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Site runs at `http://localhost:4321`.

## The plant database

The 100-species database is **not authored here**. It lives in its own repo
(`xeric-plant-system`), wherever you keep it locally. Point `PLANT_DB_PATH` at that
checkout before syncing:

```bash
export PLANT_DB_PATH=/path/to/xeric-plant-system
```

That repo's governing rule is that every fact has exactly one home — `plants.json`.
Cloudflare Pages builds from GitHub and cannot reach it, so this repo has to carry
what the site needs. What it carries is **not a copy of the database**: it is
`data/plants.public.json`, the *gated projection* of it.

The raw export is never written to disk here. `sync:plants` reads the database's
`plants.json`, passes it through `src/lib/publish-gate.js` in memory, and writes only
the result. **This repo is public**, and a verbatim copy would put all 41 estimated
fire ratings on GitHub as structured data — where `ign: 8` survives scraping and
reshaping considerably better than the `ignSrc: "est"` qualifier in the field beside
it. `data/plants.json` is gitignored so it cannot reappear by accident.

Withheld records keep `ignWithheld: true` / `cultureWithheld: true`. The public data
still says *something was deliberately withheld here* — it just never says what the
value was.

```bash
npm run sync:plants     # re-derive data/plants.public.json + the UI template
npm run check:plants    # fail if the data no longer matches source × gate
npm run audit:plants    # review what the database's rules flag before publishing
```

`check:plants` runs before every build and catches three kinds of drift:

| drift | detected | works on CI |
|---|---|---|
| the gated data was hand-edited here | `outputSha` mismatch | yes |
| the gate rule changed without a re-sync | `gateSha` mismatch | yes |
| the database moved on | re-derives and compares byte-for-byte | no — needs the source |

When the database repo is absent the third check is skipped and the build proceeds;
the first two still run. Point `PLANT_DB_PATH` at another checkout to sync elsewhere.

**Never edit `data/plants.public.json` or `src/components/XericPlantDB.template.jsx`
directly** — both are derived. Change the database, or the gate, then re-sync.

`audit:plants` reads the **database**, not the site data, and refuses to run without
it. It reports on exactly the fields the gate removes, so auditing the shipped file
would always return zero findings — a clean bill of health that means nothing.

## What is published, and what is withheld

`src/lib/publish-gate.js` is the single place that decides. Two rules, both keyed
on provenance fields rather than species names, so corrections in the database
publish automatically on the next sync:

- **Ignitability** renders only where `ignSrc` is `CSU` or `IDFW` — a published
  source. Estimated ratings (`ignSrc: "est"`) show *not established*. Of the twelve
  estimates since checked against a published source, all twelve were revised
  downward and all twelve lost their clearance to sit within 30 ft of a structure;
  the remaining estimates are not stated as safety facts.
- **Cultural notes** flagged `cultureSrc: "V"` are withheld pending a check against
  the Native American Ethnobotany Database (naeb.brit.org), per the database's own
  rule. The species still publishes; only the unverified note is held back.

Both the species pages and the interactive browser honor both rules.

The browser is built by `scripts/build-island.mjs`, which injects gated data into
the `/* __PLANTS__ */` placeholder in the synced UI template. That is why the
template is synced rather than the database's generated `out/xeric-plant-db.jsx` —
the generated file has the full dataset baked in, with no way to feed it gated
data. `build-island.mjs` refuses to emit if a withheld rating still carries a
value.

## Tuning the browser to a visitor's site

The browser's site panel takes a street address and measures the ground: elevation,
slope and aspect from USGS 3DEP over the same 120 m radius the plant system's own
site pipeline uses, folded into the same effective elevation and the same home
ignition zone bands. Checked against three built site profiles it returns the same
numbers `sitecore` does, which is the requirement — a visitor who runs this and then
commissions an analysis must not be shown two accounts of their own hillside.

It is a first pass and stays one. There is no soil, no snowpack, no skyline and
therefore no sun hours; 3DEP is bare earth, so the house and the trees are in none
of it. The panel says all of that on screen rather than in this file.

**The measurement does not always win.** Aspect is reported with a coherence number,
and below the threshold the plant system uses, the bearing is shown and deliberately
*not* applied — on dissected mountain ground a single mean bearing frequently
describes no part of the property, and a confident wrong aspect moves effective
elevation by up to 3,000 ft. Every value stays editable underneath for the same
reason: a geocode is a point on a road, not the house.

**Hardiness zone is shown, not filtered on.** It comes from the USDA 2023 map by ZIP,
and in Eagle County one ZIP spans thousands of feet. It also would not do anything:
`zoneMin` is 4 or lower for 97 of the 104 species, so at any zone this valley reaches
the filter removes nothing. Elevation is what actually selects.

**This adds `worker/`, the first server-side code here.** `astro dev` cannot serve
it, so the address lookup is dead in `npm run dev` — the panel's manual controls still
work, which is the fallback it needs anyway. To exercise the real thing:

```bash
npm run dev:worker
```

See SECURITY.md § *The plant browser's address lookup* for where the address goes and
why the geocode is proxied rather than called from the browser.

## Content

- Blog posts: `src/content/blog/*.md`
- Portfolio: **no routes, by design.** `src/pages/portfolio/` was removed because an
  empty "Built Work" page that told visitors to add files to `src/content/portfolio/`
  was publishing publicly. The collection schema is still defined in
  `src/content/config.ts`; to bring the section back, add entries under
  `src/content/portfolio/`, restore an index and `[...slug]` route, and re-add the
  nav link in `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`. Old note, kept for context: the three
  entries that shipped with the template were fabricated case studies and were
  removed. The collection and routes are intact so real projects can drop in.

Set `draft: true` on any entry not ready to publish.

## Contact form

`src/pages/contact.astro` posts to Formspree (form `mlgqrnzy`) via a hand-written
`fetch` — no SDK, no third-party script. It shows an inline thank-you without leaving
the page, and falls back to a native form POST if JavaScript is unavailable.

Both `connect-src` and `form-action` in the CSP must keep allowing `formspree.io` —
one covers each path. See SECURITY.md.

Formspree's free tier caps monthly submissions and **rejects** rather than queues over
the cap, so keep an eye on volume.

## robots.txt — deliberately not in this repo

Cloudflare serves an auto-generated `robots.txt` carrying AI-crawler content-signal
declarations. Adding `public/robots.txt` would **silently replace that policy**, so
we don't. The sitemap is discoverable anyway: `<link rel="sitemap">` in the page head,
plus `/sitemap-index.xml` by convention. Submit it in Google Search Console rather
than reaching for a robots.txt.

## Version pinning

`@astrojs/react` is pinned to **v3** with **React 18**, because this site is on
Astro 4. `astro add react` installs v6 + React 19, which builds but breaks
`astro dev`: the integration shadows the `/plants` route and serves its own config
module instead of the page. Do not upgrade the integration without upgrading Astro.

## Known gaps

- No plant images. The database's `manifest.json` is empty (0 of 100 species). Its
  rule against AI-generated plant imagery is absolute.
- 12 records mention a numeric rating in their `notes` prose, but all 12 are
  retraction notes on species *corrected* to a published value ("was ign 8
  (estimated)", now 6). None sit on a species whose rating is currently withheld, so
  they disclose a correction rather than an estimate. Left in deliberately.
- `astro.config.mjs` still has `site: 'https://example.com'` — set it to the real
  domain when DNS is wired up.

## Deploying (GitHub → Cloudflare Pages)

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard: **Workers & Pages → Create → Pages → Connect to Git**.
2. Build settings: framework preset `Astro`, build command `npm run build`, output
   directory `dist`.

The synced database files are committed, so the Cloudflare build needs nothing from
the local machine.

**This is a Worker with static assets, not a Pages project.** The distinction is
invisible until one route has to run code, and then it is total. `wrangler.jsonc`
is the whole deploy configuration:

- `name: "dry-gulch-site"` is the identity of the existing service. Changing it
  does not rename anything — it creates a second Worker and leaves the live one
  serving the old build.
- `main: "worker/index.js"` runs only for requests matching no static asset.
  Every page, font and photograph is served by the asset server without invoking
  it; `/api/site-lookup` is the one path that reaches code.
- `assets.directory: "./dist"` — including `_headers`, so the CSP and HSTS
  survive. Verified, because it is the kind of thing that fails silently.

Astro is still `output: 'static'`; nothing here needs an adapter.

**A `functions/` directory would break the build.** That is the Pages Functions
convention, and on a Worker it is not merely ignored — it pushed the build off its
Astro static preset and `wrangler deploy` failed with *"Missing entry-point to
Worker script or to assets directory."* Server code goes in `worker/`.

Until this file existed the build was configured entirely in the dashboard, where
it could not be reviewed, diffed, or reproduced from a clean clone. It is in the
repo now; change deployment here, not there.
