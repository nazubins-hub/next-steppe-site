   IGNITABILITY: 0–10 scale (Idaho Firewise methodology, adopted by
   CSU Extension Fact Sheet 6.305, rev. 7/2025). HIGHER = LESS ignitable.
   CSU recommends ONLY plants rated 8+ within 30 ft of a structure
   (Home Ignition Zones 1 and 2).
   
   ignSrc: "CSU"  = value published in FS 6.305 (or genus entry therein)
           "IDFW" = value published in the Idaho Firewise "Fire Resistance of
                    Plants Master Database" — the method CSU adopted — for
                    species FS 6.305 does not list. Published, not estimated.
           "est"  = estimated from FS 6.305 ignitability criteria
                    (resin/oil content, moisture, growth form, stem type)
   
   pf = WUCOLS-style plant factor (ETo multiplier) for water budgeting.

   CULTURAL / EDIBLE FIELDS
   edible     : { part, prep } — objective food use, or null

/* ═══════════════════ MEASURING A SITE FROM AN ADDRESS ═══════════════════

   The panel used to ask three questions. It now measures two of them.

   WHAT THIS IS
   Elevation, slope and aspect for a street address, read from the same USGS
   3DEP ImageServer that scripts/sitecore/sources/elevation.py reads, over the
   same analysis radius (SITE_RULES.analysisRadiusM), at the same 128-cell grid.
   Checked against three built site profiles it returns the same numbers:

     vail-north    elev 8287.9 ft (8287.9)  aspect 23.6° (23.8)  coh 0.85 (0.85)  slope 37.4% (37.4)
     vail-test     elev 8183.9 ft (8183.9)  aspect 202.1° (203.1) coh 0.52 (0.52)  slope 10.0% (10.0)
     grenada-glen  elev 7941.9 ft (7941.9)  aspect 276.9° (278.0) coh 0.87 (0.87)  slope 25.4% (25.4)

   That agreement is the requirement, not a nicety. A visitor who runs this and
   then commissions an analysis must not be shown two different accounts of
   their own hillside, so this measures what the pipeline measures or it has no
   business reporting a number at all.

   WHY THE GEOCODE GOES THROUGH THIS ORIGIN
   The Census geocoder sends no Access-Control-Allow-Origin, so a browser cannot
   read it. /api/site-lookup forwards. Everything after the geocode is fetched
   straight from USGS — which is given COORDINATES ONLY. The visitor's typed
   address never reaches a third party.

   WHY NOT ONE POINT SAMPLE, WHICH WOULD BE ONE CALL AND NO ARITHMETIC
   Because it is wrong. `identify` with the Aspect Degrees rule at
   5027 Main Gore Dr N returns 237° — south-west — for ground whose 120 m
   average faces 302°, north-west. A 65° error on the input that moves effective
   elevation by up to 3,000 ft, produced by a single 1 m cell sitting on a
   driveway berm. The area histogram is the entire point.

   WHY A HISTOGRAM RATHER THAN THE RASTER
   `computeHistograms` returns the distribution over an envelope as JSON, in one
   request, with CORS. The Python reads a float TIFF and averages the cells;
   this reads the same cells already binned. No TIFF parser in the browser.

   WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
   No soil, no snowpack, no skyline, no surface model — and therefore no sun
   hours. The skyline needs a directional scan over a 3 km DEM, which is a
   raster read and not a histogram, so light is not measured here and nothing
   is filtered on it. A site analysis does that. This does not pretend to. */

  /* ═══════════════════ SITE PANEL ═══════════════════
     An address, measured. 3DEP gives elevation, slope and aspect over the same
     120 m radius a site profile uses, and those three become the same effective
     elevation and fire band the full analysis computes.

     THE MEASUREMENT DOES NOT ALWAYS GET TO WIN.
     Aspect is the input that moves effective elevation by up to 3,000 ft, and
     on dissected mountain ground a single mean bearing frequently describes no
     part of the property — the coherence number says when. Below
     SITE_RULES.aspectCoherence.incoherent the panel reports the reading and
     refuses to tune on it, because a confident wrong aspect is worse than the
     slider it replaced. Every value stays editable underneath for the same
     reason: the geocode is a point on a road, not the house.

     It is still a first pass, and it still says so. What changed is which part
     is guessed — the ground is now measured, and the distance from the house,
     which no public dataset knows, is the one thing left to answer. */

          Sidebar, Card and Row are declared inside this component, so each render
          creates a fresh function identity. Rendered as an ELEMENT that reads to
          React as a different component type every time, and it responds by
          unmounting the old subtree and mounting a new one — destroying and
          rebuilding the real DOM nodes.

          For the search box that was fatal: every keystroke re-created the <input>,
          so it lost focus and mobile browsers dismissed the keyboard after a single
          letter. Calling these as plain functions inlines their JSX into this
          component's tree, so the DOM is reconciled in place and the input
          survives. It also stops all 100 cards being torn down per keystroke. */}
